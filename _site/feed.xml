<p>After getting pretty good with all this, I wonder what other options there are. Raspberry Pi SBCs now come with significant amounts of RAM and the Raspbian operating system is based on Debian. As a matter of fact, there are even Ubuntu and Debian distributions available for the Raspberry Pi.</p>]]></content><author><name>ted</name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Running Linux from RAM]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">How To Use Apt</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2022/02/09/how-to-use-apt.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="How To Use Apt" /><published>2022-02-09T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2022-02-09T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2022/02/09/how-to-use-apt</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2022/02/09/how-to-use-apt.html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="the-advanced-packaging-tool">The Advanced Packaging Tool</h1>

<p>The Advanded Packaging Tool is the most recent and commonly used tool for managing software packages in Debian based GNU/Linux distributions.</p>

<p>The Debian project created and uses a software packaging format, contained in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">*.deb</code> files, and package management tool for creating, installing, and otherwise manipulating software that is packaged in that format, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">dpkg</code> program. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">dpkg</code> program includes other tools such as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">dpkg-deb</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">dpkg-query</code>, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">dpkg-split</code> that can be used to perform low leval tasks for management of software in a Debian based GNU/Linux distribution as well as development tools such as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">dpkg-source</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">dpkg-buildpackage</code>, and others that can be used to build, package, and distribute software for those distributions.</p>

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">dpkg</code> tools function at a low level and are often too complex for most common purposes. In order to simplify common package management tasks, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">dselect</code> was created.</p>

<p>APT is a software tool used to manage software in many GNU/Linux distributions. It was created by the Debian project,</p>

<h2 id="what-installation-media">What Installation Media</h2>

<p>Debian comes in several common flavors.</p>

<p>Complete sets intended for distribution via DVD or CD. They contain the installer and most of the software available in the standard Debian repositories. Using this media allows you to install a complete Debian system with all the bells and whistles without an internet connection. These image sets are many gigabytes in size. https://www.debian.org/CD/</p>

<p>The NetInstall image which contains an installer and a minimal set of packages. Installing a full system required an internet connection so that all the remaining software can be downloaded during the installation process. This image is usually 200MB - 400MB so, and is usually where you are directed from the Debian homepage when you click “Download”</p>

<p>https://www.debian.org/distrib/</p>

<p>There’s another option, though. It’s usually called the Net Boot image. This is NOT the same as the Net Install image. It is usually less than 50MB in size and the file is called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mini.iso</code>.</p>

<p>In some countries, bananas used for cooking may be called “plantains”,

and firmness, but is usually elongated and curved, with soft flesh rich in
starch covered with a rind, which may be green, yellow, red, purple, or brown
when ripe.</p>]]></content><author><name>jill</name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[A banana is an edible fruit – botanically a berry – produced by several kinds of large herbaceous flowering plants in the genus Musa.]]></summary></entry></feed>
