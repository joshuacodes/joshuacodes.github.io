<p>Debian comes in several common flavors.</p>

<p>Complete sets intended for distribution via DVD or CD. They contain the installer and most of the software available in the standard Debian repositories. Using this media allows you to install a complete Debian system with all the bells and whistles without an internet connection. These image sets are many gigabytes in size. https://www.debian.org/CD/</p>

<p>The NetInstall image which contains an installer and a minimal set of packages. Installing a full system required an internet connection so that all the remaining software can be downloaded during the installation process. This image is usually 200MB - 400MB so, and is usually where you are directed from the Debian homepage when you click “Download”</p>

<p>https://www.debian.org/distrib/</p>

<p>There’s another option, though. It’s usually called the Net Boot image. This is NOT the same as the Net Install image. It is usually less than 50MB in size and the file is called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mini.iso</code>.</p>
